# Node.js Lord of the Rings SDK Design Document

### 1. Introduction

The Node.js Lord of the Rings SDK provides developers with a convenient way to interact with `The One API`. It will abstract away the details of making HTTP requests and handling responses, making it easier for developers to integrate our service into their applications.

### 2. Goals:

- Provide a simple and consistent interface for interacting with API.
- Abstract the HTTP communication details, error handling, and authentication.
- Allow developers to focus on using our service rather than dealing with low-level HTTP interactions.

### 3. Components:

The SDK will consist of the following main components:

- Client: Responsible for making HTTP requests to the service endpoints and handling responses.
- Authentication: Handles the authentication process.
- API Methods: A set of methods that map to the various endpoints of The One API.

### 4. SDK Usage:

Developers can use the SDK as follows:

1. Import the SDK:

```
const { initializeSDK } = require("rings-sdk");
```

2. Initialize the SDK with authentication credentials:

```
const config = {
  accessToken: "your-access-token",
  apiBaseUrl: "https://the-one-api.dev/v2",
};

const sdk = initializeSDK(config);
```

3. Use the SDK methods to interact with the service:

```
sdk
  .getMovies()
  .then((movies) => console.log(movies))
  .catch((e) => console.log(e));
```

### 5. API Methods:

The SDK will provide methods that correspond to the service's endpoints:

- getMovies(): Fetches all movies
- getMovieById(id): Fetches a specific movie for the provided movie ID.
- getQuotes(): Fetches all quotes.
- getMovieQuotes(id): Fetches specific movie quotes
- getQuoteById(id): Fetches a specific quote for the provided quote ID.

### 6. Error Handling:

The SDK handles API errors and provide meaningful error messages to developers. It will also ensure that configuration errors are properly managed.

### 7. Dependencies:

Axios: To handle HTTP requests and responses.

### 8. Testing:

Unit tests are written to cover the functionality of each SDK component and API methods.

### 9. Documentation:

Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide developers on how to use the SDK, including initialization, available methods, input parameters, and expected output.

### 10. Conclusion:

The Rings SDK offers a user-friendly way for developers to interact with Lord of the Rings `The One API`. It abstracts away the complexities of HTTP communication and authentication, making it easier for developers to integrate our service into their applications.
